This directory has code and schemas for interacting with the streaming data from OpenSky.

The python folder contains code to use with Cloud Function that will pull the latest data from OpenSky and store each
record as a separate file in GCS.

Schemas
-------

The schema folder has schema definitions for use with BigQuery and Pub/Sub.

You can check what the data looks like by creating a BigQuery table that is tied to a folder in a GCS bucket.
Use the bq_schema.json file to specify the schema since BigQuery is not able to autodetect all of the possible
values of each field, so autodetect schema will cause type mismatches between the data and the schema.
